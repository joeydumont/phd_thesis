  ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this work is to analyze the physical optics method as applied to electromagneticscattering theory and to point out its physical and mathematical drawbacks. The main conclusions are (1) that the boundary values assumed by physical optics lead to electromagnetic fields that do not satisfy the finiteness of energy condition and, as a consequence, that integral representations of these fields cannot be obtained via the divergence theorem; (2) that the commonly accepted representations are not solutions of the physical optics problem because they fail to reproduce the assumed discontinuities of the fields on the scatterer. Despite the above conclusions, the present work should not be construed as an attempt to discredit the method but rather as an effort toward a better understanding of it. As it is well known, there have been a number of occasions in which physical optics has yielded quite satisfactory results.},

  ABSTRACT = {The space of n-point correlation functions, for all possible time-orderings of operators, can be computed by a non-trivial path integral contour, which depends on how many time-ordering violations are present in the correlator. These contours, which have come to be known as timefolds, or out-of-time-order (OTO) contours, are a natural generalization of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour (which computes singly out-of-time-ordered correlation functions). We provide a detailed discussion of such higher OTO functional integrals, explaining their general structure, and the myriad ways in which a particular correlation function may be encoded in such contours. Our discussion may be seen as a natural generalization of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to higher OTO correlation functions. We provide explicit illustration for low point correlators (n=2,3,4) to exemplify the general statements.},

  ABSTRACT = {Some non linear, second order QED processes in the presence of intense plane electromagnetic waves are investigated. Analytic expressions with general kinematics are derived for Compton scattering and {\$}e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}-{\$} pair production in a circularly polarised external electromagnetic field. The differential cross sections were investigated numerically for photon energies up to 50 MeV, external field intensity parameter {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2{\$} to value 2, and all scattering angles. The variation of full cross sections with respect to external field intensity was also established. The presence of the external field led to resonances in the Compton scattering and pair production differential cross sections. These resonances were investigated by calculating the electron self energy in the presence of the external field. At resonance the differential cross sections were enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The resonances occurred for values of external field intensity parameter {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2 {<}1{\$}, lowering the limit of {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2 \backslashsim 1{\$} at which point non linear effects in first order external field QED processes become important. Generally, full cross sections increased with increasing external field intensity, though peaking sharply for Compton scattering and levelling off for pair production. An application was made to non linear background studies at {\$}e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}-{\$} linear colliders. The pair production process and electron self energy were studied for the case of a constant crossed electromagnetic field. It was found that previous analytic expressions required the external field to be azimuthally symmetric. New analytic expressions for the more general non azimuthally symmetric case were developed and a numerical parameter range equivalent to that proposed for future linear collider designs was considered.},

  ABSTRACT = {The quantum state of an electron in a strong laser field is altered if the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field is taken into account. Starting from the Schwinger-Dirac equation, we determine the states of an electron in a plane-wave field with inclusion, at leading order, of its electromagnetic self-interaction. On the one hand, the electron states show a pure "quantum" contribution to the electron quasi-momentum, conceptually different from the conventional "classical" one arising from the quiver motion of the electron. On the other hand, the electron self-interaction induces a distinct dynamics of the electron spin, whose effects are shown to be measurable in principle with available technology.},

@ARTICLE{Mourou2006,
  ABSTRACT = {The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) along with the development of high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 1018 Wcm2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification, in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse ones. In addition to this, other effects may occur, including relativistic focusing, relativistic transparency, nonlinear modulation and multiple harmonic generation, and strong coupling to matter and other fields (such as high-frequency radiation). A proper utilization of these phenomena and effects leads to the new technology of relativistic engineering, in which light-matter interactions in the relativistic regime drives the development of laser-driven accelerator science. A number of significant applications are reviewed, including the fast ignition of an inertially confined fusion target by short-pulsed laser energy and potential sources of energetic particles (electrons, protons, other ions, positrons, pions, etc.). The coupling of an intense laser field to matter also has implications for the study of the highest energies in astrophysics, such as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, with energies in excess of 1020 eV. The laser fields can be so intense as to make the accelerating field large enough for general relativistic effects (via the equivalence principle) to be examined in the laboratory. It will also enable one to access the nonlinear regime of quantum electrodynamics, where the effects of radiative damping are no longer negligible. Furthermore, when the fields are close to the Schwinger value, the vacuum can behave like a nonlinear medium in much the same way as ordinary dielectric matter expanded to laser radiation in the early days of laser research.},

We demonstrate, using asymptotic expansions, that the error can be bounded very precisely indeed at the cost of few extra derivative evaluations. Moreover, in place of derivatives it is possible to use fnite difference approximations, with spacing inversely proportional to frequency. This renders the computation of error bounds even cheaper and, more importantly, leads to a new family of quadrature methods for highly oscillatory integrals that can attain arbitrarily high asymptotic order without computation of derivatives.},

@BOOK{Press1986,
  ABSTRACT = {Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing was first published in 1986 and became an instant classic among scientists, engineers, and social scientists. In this book the original, time-tested programs have been completely reworked into a clear, consistent Pascal style. This represents a significant improvement to the immensely successful programs contained in the first edition, which were originally written in Fortran. The authors make extensive use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and other features utilized by this language. The explanatory text accompanying the programs replicates the lucid, and easy-to-read prose found in the original version, and incorporates corrections, improvements, and explanations of special Pascal features. The product of a unique collaboration among four leading scientists in academic research and industry, Numerical Recipes in Pascal fills a long-recognized need for a practical, comprehensive handbook of scientific computing in the Pascal language. The book is designed both for the Pascal programmer who wants exposure to the techniques of scientific computing, and for the working scientist, social scientist, and engineer. The scope of the book ranges from standard areas of numerical analysis (linear algebra, differential equations, roots) through subjects useful to signal processing (Fourier methods, filtering), data analysis (least squares, robust fitting, statistical functions), simulation (random deviates and Monte Carlo), and more. The lively, informal text combined with an underlying degree of mathematical sophistication makes the book useful to a wide range of readers, beginning at the advanced undergraduate level.},

@ARTICLE{Allen1992,
  ABSTRACT = {Laser light with a Laguerre-Gaussian amplitude distribution is found to have a well-defined orbital angular momentum. An astigmatic optical system may be used to transform a high-order Laguerre-Gaussian mode into a high-order Hermite-Gaussian mode reversibly. An experiment is proposed to measure the mechanical torque induced by the transfer of orbital angular momentum associated with such a transformation (19 References).},
