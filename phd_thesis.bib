abstract = {The space of n-point correlation functions, for all possible time-orderings of operators, can be computed by a non-trivial path integral contour, which depends on how many time-ordering violations are present in the correlator. These contours, which have come to be known as timefolds, or out-of-time-order (OTO) contours, are a natural generalization of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour (which computes singly out-of-time-ordered correlation functions). We provide a detailed discussion of such higher OTO functional integrals, explaining their general structure, and the myriad ways in which a particular correlation function may be encoded in such contours. Our discussion may be seen as a natural generalization of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to higher OTO correlation functions. We provide explicit illustration for low point correlators (n=2,3,4) to exemplify the general statements.},

@article{Hartin2017,
abstract = {Some non linear, second order QED processes in the presence of intense plane electromagnetic waves are investigated. Analytic expressions with general kinematics are derived for Compton scattering and {\$}e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}-{\$} pair production in a circularly polarised external electromagnetic field. The differential cross sections were investigated numerically for photon energies up to 50 MeV, external field intensity parameter {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2{\$} to value 2, and all scattering angles. The variation of full cross sections with respect to external field intensity was also established. The presence of the external field led to resonances in the Compton scattering and pair production differential cross sections. These resonances were investigated by calculating the electron self energy in the presence of the external field. At resonance the differential cross sections were enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The resonances occurred for values of external field intensity parameter {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2 {\textless}1{\$}, lowering the limit of {\$}\backslashnu{\^{}}2 \backslashsim 1{\$} at which point non linear effects in first order external field QED processes become important. Generally, full cross sections increased with increasing external field intensity, though peaking sharply for Compton scattering and levelling off for pair production. An application was made to non linear background studies at {\$}e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}-{\$} linear colliders. The pair production process and electron self energy were studied for the case of a constant crossed electromagnetic field. It was found that previous analytic expressions required the external field to be azimuthally symmetric. New analytic expressions for the more general non azimuthally symmetric case were developed and a numerical parameter range equivalent to that proposed for future linear collider designs was considered.},

abstract = {The quantum state of an electron in a strong laser field is altered if the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field is taken into account. Starting from the Schwinger-Dirac equation, we determine the states of an electron in a plane-wave field with inclusion, at leading order, of its electromagnetic self-interaction. On the one hand, the electron states show a pure "quantum" contribution to the electron quasi-momentum, conceptually different from the conventional "classical" one arising from the quiver motion of the electron. On the other hand, the electron self-interaction induces a distinct dynamics of the electron spin, whose effects are shown to be measurable in principle with available technology.},
